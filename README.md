<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The project was built as a learning exercise to practice.Since the point of this project was not to make great UI/UX design choices, I chose to create a clone of a well established product as to shorten my learning time and not to focus on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>The Blinkit Clone project was developed to strengthen my skills in front-end web development and to better understand the core principles behind e-commerce platforms.By recreating the look and feel of Blinkit, I aimed to practice building a responsive and interactive user interface while simulating real-world features such as product search, category filtering, cart management, and login validation.</p>

<h2> Features</h2>

<p> Using the search you can filter the items</p>
